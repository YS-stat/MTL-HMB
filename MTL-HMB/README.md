# README

This repository contains code and data for multi-source data integration experiments. The instructions for running the simulations and real data analysis are as follows:

---

## 1. Two Data Integration
- Use **`Simu_gaussian.ipynb`** and **`Simu_nongaussian.ipynb`** to obtain the simulation results.  
- After obtaining the results, run **`Summary Plot.ipynb`** to generate **Figure 5** in the main text.

---

## 2. Three Data Integration
- Navigate to the **three data** path.  
- Run **`run.ipynb`** directly to obtain the results.

---

## 3. Four Data Integration
- Navigate to the **four data** path.  
- Run **`run.ipynb`** directly to obtain the results.

---

## 4. ADNI Real Data
- The dataset is provided in **`ADNI_real_data.csv`**.  
- Run the following notebooks in the same path to perform the analysis:  
  - **`SDL.ipynb`**  
  - **`HTL.ipynb`**  
  - **`Proposed.ipynb`**
